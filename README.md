## Introduction
AtliQ Hardware, a major player in the industry, offers a wide range of products including Networking, Desktop, Storage, Notebook, Accessories, and Peripherals. These products are available through various channels worldwide.

AtliQ's products can be found in renowned stores such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart. These stores act as important sales outlets, connecting AtliQ's hardware with customers.

AtliQ collaborates with different types of stores. Physical retail giants like Croma and Best Buy provide in-person shopping experiences, while online platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart cater to customers who prefer to shop online.

In addition to these stores, AtliQ utilizes other distribution channels. They work with both physical and online retailers, collectively known as "Retailers." AtliQ also operates its own stores, AtliQ E-store and AtliQ Exclusive, offering direct sales to customers. Furthermore, they distribute products in bulk to intermediaries called "Distributors," who then sell them to end consumers.

Task:
- AtliQ Hardware faced big challenges managing data in Excel. Their main goal was to switch from Excel to Power BI to better understand their data. 
They wanted to focus on getting insights in finance, sales, and supply chain areas. Also create a dashboard to visualize this data transition and insights.
